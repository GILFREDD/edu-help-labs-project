# Know what to expect

We make it simple for you to get to know more about any college, course, and city before taking an admission. 

## Profiles

Everyone on eduHelp has a profile, this helps the eduHelp student advisor and the student to get to know each other. To block a seat or get in touch, you’ll be asked to provide eduHelp with your full name, photo, phone number, and email address.

## Secure Messaging

Our secure messaging tool lets you get to know eduHelp student advisor and ask questions about a college or course ahead of time. After the seat is blocked, you can use it to easily message back-and-forth to coordinate things like check-in, directions, and updates from college.
